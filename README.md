# Facebook-Engagement-Clustering
Unsupervised Machine Learning project using K-Means clustering to identify engagement behavior patterns in Facebook Live seller posts.
Project Overview

This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze engagement patterns in Facebook Live seller posts. The objective is to identify natural groupings of posts based on reactions, comments, shares, and other interaction metrics.
Using K-Means clustering, posts are segmented into distinct behavioral clusters, allowing better understanding of engagement trends.

Objective:

Analyze user engagement metrics
Perform data preprocessing and feature scaling
Apply K-Means clustering
Evaluate cluster quality using Silhouette Score
Interpret engagement behavior patterns

Why K-Means?

K-Means was chosen because:
The dataset contains numerical engagement features
The goal is to identify natural groupings
It is efficient and suitable for medium-sized datasets

Key Insights:

Posts can be grouped into meaningful engagement clusters
Certain posts generate significantly higher interaction

Feature scaling improves clustering performance

Silhouette score indicates clear cluster separation
